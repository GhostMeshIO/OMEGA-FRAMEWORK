# 💰 Value Assessment: ΩMEGA Framework v3.0
## *Intellectual Property, Market Analysis, and Strategic Roadmap*

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Version:** 3.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The ΩMEGA Framework v3.0 represents a paradigm shift in closed-loop neuromodulation, moving from heuristic stimulation to mathematically principled, provably stable control of brain dynamics. Its core value proposition lies in its ability to:

1.  **Precisely and Safely** steer a subject's brain state into a window of optimal information-processing (the "bounded near-critical regime").
2.  **Provide Convergence Guarantees** unmatched by any existing heuristic or machine-learning-based closed-loop system.
3.  **Unify** clinical application (psychiatry, neurology) with fundamental research (consciousness, cosmology) through a single, coherent mathematical language.

This assessment evaluates the framework's IP position, market potential, and a phased roadmap to commercialization and societal impact.

## 2. Intellectual Property (IP) Landscape

### 2.1 Core Patentable Assets

| Asset | Description | Novelty | Filing Strategy |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Method for Estimating Criticality Distance** | Using the aperiodic exponent (`β`) from FOOOF as a real-time control variable. | High – First application of aperiodic spectral parameterization to closed-loop control. | Provisional patent (US) + PCT, claiming the method and system (Eqs. 12-13). |
| **Bayesian Adaptive Observer for Brain States** | Precision-weighted fusion of spectral (`β`) and connectivity (`ρ`) estimators with uncertainty-scaled gain. | High – First application of Bayesian fusion for real-time brain-state estimation in a control loop. | System and method claims (Eqs. 15-16). |
| **Uncertainty-Weighted Lyapunov Controller** | Adaptive gain `k(t)` that scales inversely with estimator variance. | High – First provably stable controller for brain stimulation that is robust to measurement noise. | Control law and apparatus claims (Eqs. 19-22). |
| **Spectral-Gap Ratio (R_gap ≥ 10)** | A pre-registered, quantitative condition for model reduction validity. | Moderate – Mathematical condition, but novel in its application as a pre-clinical verification step. | Defensive publication to establish prior art. |

### 2.2 Freedom-to-Operate

*   **Clear:** tACS hardware (multiple vendors), FOOOF algorithm (open-source), Granger causality (public domain), convex optimization theory (public domain).
*   **Requires Licensing:** Real-time MEG/EEG source localization algorithms (several patents exist; site or tool-specific licenses are standard).
*   **Competitive Landscape:** No identified patents covering the specific *combination* of FOOOF, Granger, Bayesian fusion, and Lyapunov control for brain-state regulation. This creates a strong "composition of matter" style opportunity for method claims.
